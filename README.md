# Kenko (SheHacks IV, 2020)

Our inspiration for this project was that we all shared a common goal of helping improve the quality of life for individuals in adverse circumstances. 
The purpose of **Kenko** is to assist individuals who have medical conditions to manage or treat their illnesses with set meal recipes.

This website was built using HTML, CSS. 


## Note from Team
This being my team's very first hackathon and two of us having no prior knowledge in programming, finding a project that would work within our capabilities for was difficult. 
We had many ideas, but not enough knowledge in the tech field to implement all of them. However, in the end, although our project is not entirely complete, 
we were all proud of our project and of ourselves for stepping outside our comfort zone to take on a higher-level project. 
As a team, we were able to build a website and app prototypes, branding mockups, and create a project we are passionate about. Hopefully one day we will be able to put this website and app design into reality, but for now, we still have much more to learn and develop.
